# About Me

My academic journey began with obtaining my MS and BS degrees in Industrial Engineering and Mathematics from Boğaziçi University.During my MS studies, my research focused on developing an efficient feature extraction method for Numerical Weather Prediction models aimed at enhancing wind power forecasting accuracy. Specifically, I explored the adaptation of the Histogram of Oriented Gradients, a sophisticated feature transformation technique, to achieve this objective.

I am currently pursuing my PhD at TU/e within the Department of Industrial Engineering and Innovation Sciences, where I specialize in tackling planning and scheduling challenges in manufacturing processes. 

On this platform, you'll find a collection of my academic projects completed during my master's program, along with detailed insights into my teaching responsibilities. If you seek further information or wish to discuss any aspect of my work, please don't hesitate to reach out.
